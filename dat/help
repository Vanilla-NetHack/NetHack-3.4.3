	Welcome to NetHack!		   ( description of version 3.0 )

	NetHack is a Dungeons and Dragons like game where you (the adventurer)
descend into the depths of the dungeon in search of the Amulet of Yendor
(reputed to be hidden somewhere below the twentieth level).  You are
accompanied by a dog or cat that can help you in many ways and can be trained
to do all sorts of things.  On the way you will find useful (or useless)
items (quite possibly with magic properties), and assorted monsters.  You
attack a monster by trying to move into the space a monster is in (but often
it is much wiser to leave it alone).

	Unlike most adventure games, which give you a verbal description of
your location, NetHack gives you a visual image of the dungeon level you are
on.

	NetHack uses the following symbols:

	- and |  The walls of a room, also open doors.
	.	 The floor of a room or a doorway.
	#	 A corridor, or kitchen sink (if your dungeon has sinks).
	>	 A way to the next level.
	<	 A way to the previous level.
	@	 You (usually) or another human.
	)	 A weapon of some sort.
	[	 A suit or piece of armor.
	%	 A piece of food (not necessarily healthy).
	/	 A wand.
	=	 A ring.
	?	 A scroll.
	!	 A potion.
	(	 Some other useful object (pick-axe, key, lamp...)
	$	 A pile of gold.
	*	 A gem or rock (possibly valuable, possibly worthless).
	+	 A closed door, or a spell book containing a spell
		 you can learn (if your dungeon has spell books).
	^	 A trap (once you detect it).
	" 	 An amulet, or a spider web.
	0	 An iron ball.
	_	 An altar (if your dungeon has altars), or an iron chain.
	}	 A pool of water or moat.
	{	 A fountain (your dungeon may not have fountains).
	\	 An opulent throne (you may not have thrones either).
	`	 A boulder or statue.
	A to Z, a to z, and several others:  Monsters.

		 You can find out what a character represents by typing
		 '/' followed by the character, as in "/A", which will
		 tell you that 'A' is an Ape.

	#	Introduces one of the "extended" commands.  To get a list of
		the commands you can use with "#" type "#?".  The extended
		commands you can use depends upon what options the game was
		compiled with, along with your class and what type of monster
		you most closely resemble at a given moment.  If your keyboard
		has a meta key (which, when pressed in combination with another
		key, modifies it by setting the 'meta' (8th, or 'high') bit),
		these extended commands can be invoked by meta-ing the first
		letter of the command.

	If the "number_pad" option is on, some additional letter commands
	are available:

	j	Jump to another location.
	k	Kick (for doors, usually).
	l	Loot a box on the floor.
	N	Name an object or type of object.
	u	Untrap a trapped object or door.

	You can put a number before a command to repeat it that many times,
	as in "40." or "20s.".  If you have the number_pad option set, you
	must type 'n' to prefix the count, as in "n40." or "n20s".

 
	Some information is displayed on the bottom line.  You see your
	attributes, your alignment, what dungeon level you are on, how many
	hit points you have now (and will have when fully recovered), what
	your armor class is (the lower the better), your experience level,
	and the state of your stomach.  Optionally, you may or may not see
	other information such as spell points, how much gold you have, etc.

	Have Fun, and Happy Hacking!
