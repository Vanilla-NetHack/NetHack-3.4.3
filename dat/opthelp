There are further boolean options that exist in some versions of NetHack
3.1.  (You can learn which options exist in your version by checking your
current option setting, which is reached via the 'O' cmd.)

Boolean option if INSURANCE was set at compile time:
checkpoint save game state after each level change, for possible  [TRUE]
           recovery after program crash

Boolean option if NEWS was set at compile time:
news       print any news from game administrator on startup      [TRUE]

Boolean options if DGK was set at compile time:
BIOS       allow the use of IBM ROM BIOS calls                    [FALSE]
rawio      allow the use of raw I/O (may only be set on startup)  [FALSE]

Boolean option if EXP_ON_BOTL was set at compile time:

Boolean option if SCORE_ON_BOTL was set at compile time:

Boolean options if TEXTCOLOR was set at compile time:
color      use different colors for objects on screen   [TRUE for micros]
hilite_pet if color is FALSE, display pets in a highlighted way   [FALSE]

Any Boolean option can be negated by prefixing it with a '!' or 'no'.


Compound options are written as option_name:option_value.

Compound options which can be set during the game are:

fruit      the name of a fruit you enjoy eating  [slime mold]
           (basically a whimsy which NetHack uses from time to time).
packorder  a list of default symbols for kinds of objects that gives the
           order in which your pack will be displayed  [")[%?+!=/(*`0_]
           (If you specify only some kinds of items, the others from the
           default order will be appended to the end.)
scores     the parts of the score list you wish to see when the game ends
           You choose a combination of top scores, scores around the top
           scores, and all of your own scores.  [!own/3 top/2 around]

Compound options which may be set only on startup are:

catname    the name of your first cat  [NONE]
dogname    the name of your first dog  [NONE]
graphics   a list of symbols to be used in place of the default ones for
           drawing the dungeon.
           The symbols are subjected to a fair amount of processing, so
           that you can use C-style escapes such as \n or \081 as well as
           indicate control characters by ^x or meta characters by \Mx.
           As usual, \ can force the next character to be taken literally.
           Since many of the default symbols are overloaded, they are
           given here by name instead of symbol, with some added notes:
           stone                               (solid rock, normally ' ')
           vwall hwall tlcorn trcorn blcorn brcorn      (room boundaries)

           air cloud water
           vbeam hbeam lslant rslant                  (generic zap beams)
           digbeam flashbeam      (special beams for digging and cameras)
           boomleft boomright                                (boomerangs)
           ss1 ss2 ss3 ss4                           (shielding sequence)
           sw_topl, sw_topm, sw_topr,                  (swallow, top row)
           sw_midl, sw_midr,            (swallow, middle row [no center])
           sw_botl, sw_botm, sw_botr                (swallow, bottom row)
           extl extm extr                      (explosion matrix top row)
           exml exmm exmr                   (explosion matrix middle row)
           exbl exbm exbr                   (explosion matrix bottom row)
monsters   like graphics, but for monster symbols
           default:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
                     ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ@\ \\&;:~]
msghistory number of top line messages to save [20]
name       the name of your character  [obtained by asking the system or
           the player]
objects    like graphics, but for object symbols
           default:  ])[="(%!?+/$*`0_.
pettype    your preferred type of pet (cat or dog), if your character
           class uses both types  [RANDOM]
windowtype windowing system to be used  [depends on operating system]
