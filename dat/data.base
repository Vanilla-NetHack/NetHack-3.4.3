*amnesia
Maud
	Get thee hence, nor come again,
	Mix not memory with doubt,
	Pass, thou deathlike type of pain,
	Pass and cease to move about!
	'Tis the blot upon the brain
	That will show itself without.
		...
	For, Maud, so tender and true,
	As long as my life endures
	I feel I shall owe you a debt,
	That I never can hope to pay;
	And if ever I should forget
	That I owe this debt to you
	And for your sweet sake to yours;
	O then, what then shall I say? -
	If ever I should forget,
	May God make me more wretched
	Than ever I have been yet!
		[ Maud, And Other Poems by Alfred Lord Tennyson ]
angel*
	He answered and said unto them, he that soweth the good seed
	is the Son of man; the field is the world, and the good seed
	are the children of the kingdom; but the weeds are the
	children of the wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is the
	devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers
	are the angels.  As therefore the weeds are gathered and
	burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
	[...]  So shall it be at the end of the world; the angels
	shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
	and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be
	wailing and gnashing of teeth.
		[ The Gospel According to Matthew, 13:37-42, 49-50 ]
anhur
	An Egyptian god of war and a great hunter, few gods can match
	his fury.  Unlike many gods of war, he is a force for good.
	The wrath of Anhur is slow to come, but it is inescapable
	once earned.  Anhur is a mighty figure with four arms.  He
	is often seen with a powerful lance that requires both of
	his right arms to wield and which is tipped with a fragment
	of the sun.  He is married to Mehut, a lion-headed goddess.
ankh-morpork
	The twin city of Ankh-Morpork, foremost of all the cities
	bounding the Circle Sea, was as a matter of course the home
	of a large number of gangs, thieves' guilds, syndicates and
	similar organisations.  This was one of the reasons for its
	wealth.  Most of the humbler folk on the widdershin side of
	the river, in Morpork's mazy alleys, supplemented their
	meagre incomes by filling some small role for one or other
	of the competing gangs.
	    [ The Colour of Magic by Terry Pratchett ]
anshar
	A primordial Babylonian-Akkadian deity, Anshar is mentioned
	in the Babylonian creation epic _Enuma Elish_ as one of a

	Babylon, Uruk and other cities.
*ape
	The most highly evolved of all the primates, as shown by
	all their anatomical characters and particularly the
	development of the brain.  Both arboreal and terrestrial,
	the apes have the forelimbs much better developed than
	the hind limbs.  Tail entirely absent.  Growth is slow
	and sexual maturity reached at quite an advanced age.
	[ A Field Guide to the Larger Mammals of Africa by Dorst ]

	Aldo the gorilla had a plan.  It was a good plan.  It was
	right.  He knew it.  He smacked his lips in anticipation as
	he thought of it.  Yes.  Apes should be strong.  Apes should
	be masters.  Apes should be proud.  Apes should make the
	Earth shake when they walked.  Apes should _rule_ the Earth.
		[ Battle for the Planet of the Apes,
			by David Gerrold ]
archon
	Archons are the predominant inhabitants of the heavens.
	However unusual their appearance, they are not generally
	evil.  They are beings at peace with themselves and their
	surroundings.
ashikaga takauji
	Ashikaga Takajui was a daimyo of the Minamoto clan who
	joined forces with the Go-Daigo to defeat the Hojo armies.
	Later when Go-Daigo attempted to reduce the powers of the
	samurai clans he rebelled against him.  He defeated Go-
	Daigo and established the emperor Komyo on the throne.

	staff with a handle at one end and a cradle for the spear at
	the other.
axolotl
	A mundane salamander, harmless.
b*lzebub
	The "lord of the flies" is a translation of the Hebrew
	Ba'alzevuv (Beelzebub in Greek).  It has been suggested that
	it was a mistranslation of a mistransliterated word which
	gave us this pungent and suggestive name of the Devil, a
	devil whose name suggests that he is devoted to decay,
	destruction, demoralization, hysteria and panic...
		[ Notes on _Lord of the Flies_, by E. L. Epstein ]
balrog
	...  It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as
	if a cloud had bent over it.  Then with a rush it leaped
	the fissure.  The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed
	about it; and a black smoke swirled in the air.  Its streaming
	mane kindled, and blazed behind it.  In its right hand
	was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it
	held a whip of many thongs.
	'Ai, ai!' wailed Legolas.  'A Balrog!  A Balrog is come!'
		   [ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
baluchitherium
titanothere
	Extinct rhinos include a variety of forms, the most
	spectacular being _Baluchitherium_ from the Oligocene of
	Asia, which is the largest known land mammal.  Its body, 18
	feet high at the shoulder and carried on massive limbs,
	allowed the 4-foot-long head to browse on the higher branches
	of trees.  Though not as enormous, the titanotheres of the
	early Tertiary were also large perissodactyls, _Brontotherium_
	of the Oligocene being 8 feet high at the shoulder.
		[Prehistoric Animals, by Barry Cox ]
barbarian
	They dressed alike -- in buckskin boots, leathern breeks and
	deerskin shirts, with broad girdles that held axes and short
	swords; and they were all gaunt and scarred and hard-eyed;
	sinewy and taciturn.
	They were wild men, of a sort, yet there was still a wide
	gulf between them and the Cimmerian.  They were sons of
	civilization, reverted to a semi-barbarism.  He was a
	barbarian of a thousand generations of barbarians.  They had
	acquired stealth and craft, but he had been born to these
	things.  He excelled them even in lithe economy of motion.
	They were wolves, but he was a tiger.
	    [ Conan - The Warrior, by Robert E. Howard ]
barbed devil
	Barbed devils lack any real special abilities, though they
	are quite difficult to kill.
*bat
	A bat, flitting in the darkness outside, took the wrong turn
	as it made its nightly rounds and came in through the window
	which had been left healthfully open.  It then proceeded to
	circle the room in the aimless fat-headed fashion habitual
	with bats, who are notoriously among the less intellectually
	gifted of God's creatures.  Show me a bat, says the old
	proverb, and I will show you something that ought to be in
	some kind of a home.
		[ A Pelican at Blandings, by P. G. Wodehouse ]
*bee
	This giant variety of its useful normal cousin normally
	appears in small groups, looking for raw material to produce
	the royal jelly needed to feed their queen.  On rare
	occasions, one may stumble upon a bee-hive, in which the
	queen bee is being well provided for, and guarded against
	intruders.
*beetle
	The common name for the insects with wings shaped like
	shields (_Coleoptera_), one of the ten sub-species into
	which the insects are divided.  They are characterized by
	the shields (the front pair of wings) under which the back
	wings are folded.

bell of opening
	"A bell, book and candle job."
	The Bursar sighed.  "We tried that, Archchancellor."
	The Archchancellor leaned towards him.
	"Eh?" he said.
	"I _said_, we tried that Archchancellor," said the Bursar loudly,
	directing his voice at the old man's ear.  "After dinner, you
	remember?  We used Humptemper's _Names of the Ants_ and rang Old
	Tom."*
	"Did we, indeed.  Worked, did it?"
	"_No_, Archchancellor."

	* Old Tom was the single cracked bronze bell in the University
	bell tower.
		[ Eric, by Terry Pratchett ]
blind io
	On this particular day Blind Io, by dint of constant vigilance
	the chief of the gods, sat with his chin on his hand
	and looked at the gaming board on the red marble table in
	front of him.  Blind Io had got his name because, where his
	eye sockets should have been, there were nothing but two
	areas of blank skin.  His eyes, of which he had an impressively
	large number, led a semi-independent life of their
	own.  Several were currently hovering above the table.
	    [ The Colour of Magic, by Terry Pratchett ]
* blob
	Animated protoplasm.
bone devil
	Bone devils attack with weapons and with a great hooked tail
	which causes a loss of strength to those they sting.
book of the dead
	Faustus: Come on Mephistopheles.  What shall we do?
	Mephistopheles: Nay, I know not.  We shall be cursed with bell,
	book, and candle.
	Faustus: How?  Bell, book, and candle, candle, book, and bell,
	Forward and backward, to curse Faustus to hell.
	Anon you shall hear a hog grunt, a calf bleat, and an ass bray,
	Because it is Saint Peter's holy day.
	(Enter all the Friars to sing the dirge)
		[ Doctor Faustus and Other Plays, by Christopher Marlowe ]
brigit
	Brigit (Brigid, Bride, Banfile), which means the Exalted One,
	was the Celtic (continental European and Irish) fertility
	goddess.  She was originally celebrated on February first in
	the festival of Imbolc, which coincided with the beginning
	of lactation in ewes and was regarded in Scotland as the date
	on which Brigit deposed the blue-faced hag of winter.  The
	Christian calendar adopted the same date for the Feast of St.
	Brigit.  There is no record that a Christian saint ever
	actually existed, but in Irish mythology she became the
	midwife to the Virgin Mary.
		[ Encyclopedia of Gods, by Michael Jordan ]
bugbear
	Bugbears are relatives of goblins, although they tend to be
	larger and more hairy.  They are aggressive carnivores and
	sometimes kill just for the treasure their victims may be
	carrying.
*camaxtli
	A classical Mesoamerican Aztec god, also known as Mixcoatl-
	Camaxtli (the Cloud Serpent), Camaxtli is the god of war.  He
	is also a diety of hunting and fire who received human
	sacrifice of captured prisoners.  According to tradition, the
	sun god Tezcatlipoca transformed himself into Mixcoatl-Camaxtli
	to make fire by twirling the sacred fire sticks.
		[ Encyclopedia of Gods, by Michael Jordan ]
s*d*g*r* cat
	Imagine a sealed container, so perfectly constructed that no
	physical influence can pass either inwards or outwards across its
	walls.  Imagine that inside the container is a cat, and also a
	device that can be triggered by some quantum event.  If that event
	takes place, then the device smashes a phial containing cyanide and
	the cat is killed.  If the event does not take place, the cat lives
	on.  In Schroedinger's original version, the quantum event was the
	decay of a radioactive atom.  ...  To the outside observer, the cat
	is indeed in a linear combination of being alive and dead, and only
	when the container is finally opened would the cat's state vector
	collapse into one or the other.  On the other hand, to a (suitably
	protected) observer inside the container, the cat's state-vector
	would have collapsed much earlier, and the outside observer's
	linear combination has no relevance.
	        [ The Emperor's New Mind, by Roger Penrose ]
*cat
kitten
	Well-known quadruped domestic animal from the family of
	predatory felines (_Felis ochreata domestica_), with a thick,
	soft pelt; often kept as a pet.  Various folklores have the
	cat associated with magic and the gods of ancient Egypt.
*centaur
	Of all the monsters put together by the Greek imagination
	the Centaurs (Kentauroi) constituted a class in themselves.
	Despite a strong streak of sensuality, in their make-up,
	their normal behaviour was moral, and they took a kindly
	thought of man's welfare.  The attempted outrage of Nessos on
	Deianeira, and that of the whole tribe of Centaurs on the
	Lapith women, are more than offset by the hospitality of
	Pholos and by the wisdom of Cheiron, physician, prophet,
	lyrist, and the instructor of Achilles.  Further, the
	Centaurs were peculiar in that their nature, which united the
	body of a horse with the trunk and head of a man, involved
	an unthinkable duplication of vital organs and important
	members.  So grotesque a combination seems almost un-Greek.
	These strange creatures were said to live in the caves and
	clefts of the mountains, myths associating them especially
	with the hills of Thessaly and the range of Erymanthos.
		     [ Mythology of all races, Vol. 1, pp. 270-271 ]
cerberus
kerberos
	Cerberus, (or Kerberos in Greek), was the three-headed dog
	that guarded the Gates of Hell.  He allowed any dead to enter,
	and likewise prevented them all from ever leaving.  He was
	bested only twice:  once when Orpheus put him to sleep by
	playing bewitching music on his lyre, and the other time when
	Hercules confronted him and took him to the world of the
	living (as his twelfth and last labor).
chameleon
	Name of a family (_Chameleonidae_) and race (_Chameleo_) of
	scaly lizards, especially the _Chameleo vulgaris_ species,
	with a short neck, claws, a grasping tail, a long, extendible
	tongue and mutually independent moving eyes.  When it is
	scared or angry, it inflates itself and its transparent skin
	shows its blood:  the skin first appears greenish, then
	gradually changes color until it is a spotted red.  The final
	color depends on the background color as well, hence the
	(figurative) implication of unreliability.  [Capitalized:]
	a constellation of the southern hemisphere (Chameleo).
	    [ Van Dale's Groot Woordenboek der Nederlandse Taal ]
charo*n
	When an ancient Greek died, his soul went to the nether world:
	the Hades.  To reach the nether world, the souls had to cross
	the river Styx, the river that separated the living from the
	dead.  The Styx could be crossed by ferry, whose shabby ferry-
	man, advanced in age, was called Charon.  The deceased's next-
	of-kin would place a coin under his tongue, to pay the ferry-
	man.
chih*sung*tzu
	A Chinese rain god.
chromatic dragon
tiamat
	Tiamat is said to be the mother of evil dragonkind.  She is
	extremely vain.
cockatrice
	Once in a great while, when the positions of the stars are
	just right, a seven-year-old rooster will lay an egg.  Then,
	along will come a snake, to coil around the egg, or a toad,
	to squat upon the egg, keeping it warm and helping it to
	hatch.  When it hatches, out comes a creature called basilisk,
	or cockatrice, the most deadly of all creatures.  A single
	glance from its yellow, piercing toad's eyes will kill both
	man and beast.  Its power of destruction is said to be so
	great that sometimes simply to hear its hiss can prove fatal.
	Its breath is so venomous that it causes all vegetation
	to wither.

	There is, however, one creature which can withstand the
	basilisk's deadly gaze, and this is the weasel.  No one knows
	why this is so, but although the fierce weasel can slay the
	basilisk, it will itself be killed in the struggle.  Perhaps
	the weasel knows the basilisk's fatal weakness:  if it ever
	sees its own reflection in a mirror it will perish instantly.
	But even a dead basilisk is dangerous, for it is said that
	merely touching its lifeless body can cause a person to
	sicken and die.

cornuthaum
	He was dressed in a flowing gown with fur tippets which had
	the signs of the zodiac embroidered over it, with various
	cabalistic signs, such as triangles with eyes in them, queer
	crosses, leaves of trees, bones of birds and animals, and a
	planetarium whose stars shone like bits of looking-glass with
	the sun on them.  He had a pointed hat like a dunce's cap, or
	like the headgear worn by ladies of that time, except that
	the ladies were accustomed to have a bit of veil floating
	from the top of it.
                        [ The Once and Future King, by T.H. White ]

		"A wizard!" Dooley exclaimed, astounded.
		"At your service, sirs," said the wizard.  "How
	perceptive of you to notice.  I suppose my hat rather gives me
	away.  Something of a beacon, I don't doubt."  His hat was
	pretty much that, tall and cone-shaped with stars and crescent
	moons all over it.  All in all, it couldn't have been more
	wizardish.

couatl
	A mythical feathered serpent.  The couatl are very rare.
cram*
	If you want to know what cram is, I can only say that I don't
	know the recipe; but it is biscuitish, keeps good indefinitely,
	is supposed to be sustaining, and is certainly not entertaining,
	being in fact very uninteresting except as a chewing
	exercise.  It was made by the Lake-men for long journeys.

*crocodile
	A big animal with the appearance of a lizard, constituting
	an order of the reptiles (_Loricata_ or _Crocodylia_), the
	crocodile is a large, dangerous predator native to tropical
	and subtropical climes.  It spends most of its time in large
	bodies of water.
croesus
kroisos
creosote
	Croesus (in Greek: Kroisos), the wealthy last king of Lydia;
	his empire was destroyed when he attacked Cyrus in 549, after
	the Oracle of Delphi (q.v.) had told him:  "if you attack the
	Persians, you will destroy a mighty empire".  Herodotus
	relates of his legendary conversation with Solon of Athens,
	who impressed upon him that being rich does not imply being
	happy and that no one should be considered fortunate before
	his death.
crom
	Warily Conan scanned his surroundings, all of his senses alert
	for signs of possible danger.  Off in the distance, he could
	see the familiar shapes of the Camp of the Duali tribe.
	Suddenly, the hairs on his neck stand on end as he detects the
	aura of evil magic in the air.  Without thought, he readies
	his weapon, and mutters under his breath:
	"By Crom, there will be blood spilt today."

	  L. Sprague de Camp ]
cyclops
	And after he had milked his cattle swiftly,
	he again took hold of two of my men
	and had them as his supper.
	Then I went, with a tub of red wine,
	to stand before the Cyclops, saying:
	"A drop of wine after all this human meat,
	so you can taste the delicious wine
	that is stored in our ship, Cyclops."
	He took the tub and emptied it.
	He appreciated the priceless wine that much
	that he promptly asked me for a second tub.
	"Give it", he said, "and give me your name as well".
			...
	Thrice I filled the tub,
	and after the wine had clouded his mind,
	I said to him, in a tone as sweet as honey:
	"You have asked my name, Cyclops?  Well,
	my name is very well known.  I'll give it to you,
	if you give me the gift you promised me as a guest.
	My name is Nobody.  All call me thus:
	my father and my mother and my friends."
	Ruthlessly he answered to this:
	"Nobody, I will eat you last of all;
	your host of friends will completely precede you.
	That will be my present to you, my friend."
	And after these words he fell down backwards,
	restrained by the all-restrainer Hupnos.
	His monstrous neck slid into the dust;
	the red wine squirted from his throat;
	the drunk vomited lumps of human flesh.
		[ The Odyssey, (chapter Epsilon), by Homer ]
dark one
	... But he ruled rather by force and fear, if they might
	avail; and those who perceived his shadow spreading over the
	world called him the Dark Lord and named him the Enemy; and
	he gathered again under his government all the evil things of
	the days of Morgoth that remained on earth or beneath it,
	and the Orcs were at his command and multiplied like flies.
	Thus the Black Years began ...

demogorgon
	Demogorgon, the prince of demons, wallows in filth and can
	spread a quickly fatal illness to his victims while rending

	of mortals with a touch of his tail.
dispater
	Dispater is an arch-devil who rules the city of Dis.  He is
	a powerful mage.
djinn*
	The djinn are genies from the elemental plane of Air.  There,
	among their kind, they have their own societies.  They are
	sometimes encountered on earth and may even be summoned here
	to perform some service for powerful wizards.  The wizards
	often leave them about for later service, safely tucked away
	in a flask or lamp.  Once in a while, such a tool is found by
	a lucky rogue, and some djinn are known to be so grateful
	when released that they might grant their rescuer a wish.
*dog
pup*
	A domestic animal, the _tame dog_ (_Canis familiaris_), of
	which numerous breeds exist.  The male is called a dog,
	while the female is called a bitch.  Because of its known
	loyalty to man and gentleness with children, it is the
	world's most popular domestic animal.  It can easily be
	trained to perform various tasks.
*dragon
*xoth
	In the West the dragon was the natural enemy of man.  Although
	preferring to live in bleak and desolate regions, whenever it
	was seen among men it left in its wake a trail of destruction
	and disease.  Yet any attempt to slay this beast was a perilous
	undertaking.  For the dragon's assailant had to contend
	not only with clouds of sulphurous fumes pouring from its fire
	breathing nostrils, but also with the thrashings of its tail,
	the most deadly part of its serpent-like body.
	[Mythical Beasts by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library)]
dwarf*
	Dwarfs have faces like men (ugly men, with wrinkled, leathery
	skins), but are generally either flat-footed, duck-footed, or
	have feet pointing backwards.  They are of the earth, earthy,
	living in the darkest of caverns and venturing forth only
	with the cloaks by which they can make themselves invisible,
	and others disguised as toads.  Miners often come across them,
	and sometimes establish reasonably close relations with them.
	... The miners of Cornwall were always delighted to hear a
	bucca busily mining away, for all dwarfs have an infallible
	nose for precious metals.
	Among other things, dwarfs are rightly valued for their skill
	as blacksmiths and jewellers: they made Odin his famous spear
	Gungnir, and Thor his hammer; for Freya they designed a
	magnificent necklace, and for Frey a golden boar.  And in their
	spare time they are excellent bakers.  Ironically, despite
	their odd feet, they are particularly fond of dancing.  They
	can also see into the future, and consequently are excellent
	meteorologists.  They can be free with presents to people
	they like, and a dwarvish gift is likely to turn to gold in
	the hand.  But on the whole they are a snappish lot.

earendil
elwing
	In after days, when because of the triumph of Morgoth Elves and
	Men became estranged, as he most wished, those of the Elven-race
	that lived still in Middle-earth waned and faded, and Men usurped
	the sunlight.  Then the Quendi wandered in the lonely places of the
	great lands and the isles, and took to the moonlight and the
	starlight, and to the woods and the caves, becoming as shadows
	and memories, save those who ever and anon set sail into the West
	and vanished from Middle-earth.  But in the dawn of years Elves
	and Men were allies and held themselves akin, and there were some
	among Men that learned the wisdom of the Eldar, and became great
	and valiant among the captains of the Noldor.  And in the glory

eel
giant eel
	The behaviour of eels in fresh water extends the air of
	mystery surrounding them.  They move freely into muddy, silty
	bottoms of lakes, lying buried in the daylight hours in summer.
	[...]  Eels are voracious carnivores, feeding mainly at
	night and consuming a wide variety of fishes and invertebrate
	creatures.  Contrary to earlier thinking, eels seek living
	rather than dead creatures and are not habitual eaters of
	carrion.

	... Even as they stepped over the threshold a single clear
	voice rose in song.

	Frodo halted for a moment, looking back.  Elrond was in his
	chair and the fire was on his face like summer-light upon the
	trees.  Near him sat the Lady Arwen.  [...]
	He stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the
	elvish song fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody.
	"It is a song to Elbereth," said Bilbo.  "They will sing that,
	and other songs of the Blessed Realm, many times tonight.
	Come on!"

electric eel
	South-American fish (_Gymnotus electricus_), living in fresh

	This eel is known for its electrical organ which enables it

*elemental
	Elementals are manifestations of the basic nature of the
	universe.  There are four known forms of elementals:  air, fire,

	for a fifth type, the spirit elemental, but none have ever
	been encountered, at least on this plane of existence.
~elf ??m*
*elf*
elvenking
	The Elves sat round the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn
	rings of old trunks.  Some went to and fro bearing cups and
	pouring drinks; others brought food on heaped plates and
	dishes.
	"This is poor fare," they said to the hobbits; "for we are
	lodging in the greenwood far from our halls.  If ever you are
	our guests at home, we will treat you better."
	"It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party," said Frodo.
	Pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink, for
	his mind was filled with the light upon the elf-faces, and the
	sound of voices so various and so beautiful that he felt in a
	waking dream.  [...]
	Sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to
	himself, what he felt or thought that night, though it remained
	in his memory as one of the chief events of his life.  The
	nearest he ever got was to say: "Well, sir, if I could grow
	apples like that, I would call myself a gardener.  But it was
	the singing that went to my heart, if you know what I mean."

excalibur
	At first only its tip was visible, but then it rose, straight,
	proud, all that was noble and great and wondrous.  The tip of
	the blade pointed toward the moon, as if it would cleave it
	in two.  The blade itself gleamed like a beacon in the night.
	There was no light source for the sword to be reflecting
	from, for the moon had darted behind a cloud in fear.  The
	sword was glowing from the intensity of its strength and
	power and knowledge that it was justice incarnate, and that
	after a slumber of uncounted years its time had again come.
	After the blade broke the surface, the hilt was visible, and
	holding the sword was a single strong, yet feminine hand,
	wearing several rings that bore jewels sparkling with the
	blue-green color of the ocean.
		[ Knight Life, by Peter David ]
eye of the aethiopica
	This is a powerful amulet of ESP.  In addition to its standard
	powers, it regenerates the energy of anyone who carries
	it, allowing them to cast spells more often.  It also reduces
	any spell damage to the person who carries it by half, and
	protects from magic missiles.  Finally, when invoked it has
	the power to instantly open a portal to any other area of the
	dungeon, allowing its invoker to travel quickly between
	areas.
floating eye
	Floating eyes, not surprisingly, are large, floating eyeballs
	which drift about the dungeon.  Though not dangerous in and
	of themselves, their power to paralyse those who gaze at
	their large eye in combat is widely feared.  Many are the
	tales of those who struck a floating eye, were paralysed by
	its mystic powers, and then nibbled to death by some other
	creature that lurked around nearby.
flesh golem
	With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected
	the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark
	of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.  It was
	already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against
	the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the
	glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow
	eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive
	motion agitated its limbs.

	How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how
	delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I
	had endeavoured to form?  His limbs were in proportion, and I
	had selected his features as beautiful.  Beautiful!--Great God! 
	His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and
	arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and
	flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances
	only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that
	seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in
	which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight
	black lips.

*fung*
	Fungi, division of simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true
	stems, roots, and leaves.  Unlike algae, fungi cannot
	photosynthesize, and live as parasites or saprophytes.  The
	division comprises the slime molds and true fungi.  True
	fungi are multicellular (with the exception of yeasts); the
	body of most true fungi consists of slender cottony
	filaments, or hyphae.  All fungi are capable of asexual
	reproduction by cell division, budding, fragmentation, or
	spores.  Those that reproduce sexually alternate a sexual
	generation (gametophyte) with a spore-producing one.  The
	four classes of true fungi are the algaelike fungi (e.g.,
	black bread mold and downy mildew), sac fungi (e.g., yeasts,
	powdery mildews, truffles, and blue and green molds such as
	Penicillium), basidium fungi (e.g., mushrooms and puffballs)
	and imperfect fungi (e.g., species that cause athlete's foot
	and ringworm).  Fungi help decompose organic matter (important
	in soil renewal); are valuable as a source of antibiotics,
	vitamins, and various chemicals; and for their role in
	fermentation, e.g., in bread and alcoholic beverage
	production.

*gargoyle
	And so it came to pass that while Man ruled on Earth, the
	gargoyles waited, lurking, hidden from the light.  Reborn
	every 600 years in Man's reckoning of time, the gargoyles
	joined battle against Man to gain dominion over the Earth.

	In each coming, the gargoyles were nearly destroyed by Men
	who flourished in greater numbers.  Now it has been so many
	hundreds of years that it seems the ancient statues and
	paintings of gargoyles are just products of Man's
	imagination.  In this year, with Man's thoughts turned toward
	the many ills he has brought among himself, Man has forgotten
	his most ancient adversary, the gargoyles.

	And now the souls of the dead who had gone below came swarming
	up from Erebus -- fresh brides, unmarried youths, old men
	with life's long suffering behind them, tender young girls
	still nursing this first anguish in their hearts, and a great
	throng of warriors killed in battle, their spear-wounds gaping
	yet and all their armour stained with blood.  From this
	multitude of souls, as they fluttered to and fro by the

	a sort, especially a hat.  And he was clearly just as frightened
	as the imps though he could not go so fast.  Ramon Alonzo
	saw that there must be some great trouble that was vexing
	magical things; and, since gnomes speak the language of men, and
	will answer if spoken to gently, he raised his hat, and asked
	of the gnome his name.  The gnome did not stop his hasty
	shuffle a moment as he answered 'Alaraba' and grabbed the rim
	of his hat but forgot to doff it.
	'What is the trouble, Alaraba?'  said Ramon Alonzo.

~flesh golem
*golem
	"The original story harks back, so they say, to the sixteenth
	century.  Using long-lost formulas from the Kabbala, a rabbi is
	said to have made an artificial man -- the so-called Golem -- to
	help ring the bells in the Synagogue and for all kinds of other
	menial work.
	"But he hadn't made a full man, and it was animated by some sort
	of vegetable half-life.  What life it had, too, so the story
	runs, was only derived from the magic charm placed behind its
	teeth each day, that drew down to itself what was known as the
	`free sidereal strength of the universe.'
	"One evening, before evening prayers, the rabbi forgot to take
	the charm out of the Golem's mouth, and it fell into a frenzy.
	It raged through the dark streets, smashing everything in its
	path, until the rabbi caught up with it, removed the charm, and
	destroyed it.  Then the Golem collapsed, lifeless.  All that was
	left of it was a small clay image, which you can still see in
	the Old Synagogue." ...

	the beam connection, Yori.  You two can keep a watch out for
	grid bugs."  Tron paced forward along the slender catwalk
	that still seemed awfully insubstantial to Flynn, though he
	knew it to be amazingly sturdy.  He gazed after Tron, asking
	himself what in the world a grid bug was, and hoping that the
	beam connection -- to which he'd given no thought whatsoever
	until this moment -- was healthy and sound."

	The other three drew in their breath sharply, and the dark,

	stealthy step padded outside the barred and bolted door. ...
	But none looked aside from the mummy case over which the man
	in the ermine-trimmed robe was now moving the great flaming
	jewel, while he muttered an incantation that was old when
	Atlantis sank.  The glare of the gem dazzled their eyes, so
	that they could not be sure what they saw; but with a
	splintering crash, the carven lid of the sarcophagus burst
	outward as if from some irresistible pressure applied from
	within and the four men, bending eagerly forward, saw the
	occupant -- a huddled, withered, wizened shape, with dried
	brown limbs like dead wood showing through moldering bandages.
	"Bring that thing back?" muttered the small dark man who
	stood on the right, with a short, sardonic laugh.  "It is

	soot black.  It stands two to three feet high at the shoulder
	and has a distinct odour of smoke and sulphur.  The baying
	sounds it makes have an eerie, hollow tone that sends a shiver
	through any who hear them.

	a great deal of travelling and speaking in public, he became
	the god of eloquence, travellers, merchants, and thieves.  He
	was one of the most energetic of the Greek gods, a
	Machiavellian character full of trickery and sexual vigour.
	Like other Greek gods, he is endowed with not-inconsiderable
	sexual prowess which he directs towards countryside nymphs.
	He is a god of boundaries, guardian of graves and patron deity
	of shepherds.  He is usually depicted as a handsome young
	man wearing winged golden sandals and holding a magical
	herald's staff consisting of intertwined serpents, the
	kerykeion.  He is reputedly the only being able to find his way
	to the underworld ferry of Charon and back again.  He is said

hobbit
	Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more

	farmed countryside was their favourite haunt.  They do not
	and did not understand or like machines more complicated
	than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a handloom, although
	they were skillful with tools.  Even in ancient days they

hobgoblin
	Hobgoblin.  Used by the Puritans and in later times for
	wicked goblin spirits, as in Bunyan's "Hobgoblin nor foul
	friend", but its more correct use is for the friendly spirits
	of the brownie type.  In "A midsummer night's dream" a
	fairy says to Shakespeare's Puck:
		Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,
		You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
		Are you not he?
	and obviously Puck would not wish to be called a hobgoblin
	if that was an ill-omened word.
	Hobgoblins are on the whole, good-humoured and ready to be
	helpful, but fond of practical joking, and like most of the
	fairies rather nasty people to annoy.  Boggarts hover on the
	verge of hobgoblindom.  Bogles are just over the edge.
	One Hob mentioned by Henderson, was Hob Headless who haunted
	the road between Hurworth and Neasham, but could not cross
	the little river Kent, which flowed into the Tess.  He was
	exorcised and laid under a large stone by the roadside for
	ninety-nine years and a day.  If anyone was so unwary as to
	sit on that stone, he would be unable to quit it for ever.
	The ninety-nine years is nearly up, so trouble may soon be
	heard of on the road between Hurworth and Neasham.

hom*nculus
	A homunculus is a creature summoned by a mage to perform some

	the effect does not last long on humans.

	"Tothapis cut him off.  'Be still and hearken.  You will travel

juiblex
jubilex
	Little is known about the Faceless Lord, even the correct
	spelling of his name.  He does not have a physical form as
	we know it, and those who have peered into his realm claim
	he is a slime-like creature who swallows other creatures
	alive, spits acidic secretions, and causes disease in his
	victims which can be almost instantly fatal.
kabuto
	The kabuto is the helmet worn by the samurai.  It was
	characterized by a prominent beaked front which jutted out over
	the brow to protect the wearer's face; a feature that gives
	rise to their modern Japanese name of 'shokaku tsuki kabuto'
	(battering-ram helmet).  Their main constructional element
	was an oval plate, the shokaku bo, slightly domed for the
	head with a narrow prolongation in front that curved forwards
	and downwards where it developed a pronounced central
	fold.  Two horizontal strips encircling the head were riveted
	to this frontal strip:  the lower one, the koshimaki (hip
	wrap), formed the lower edge of the helmet bowl; the other,
	the do maki (body wrap), was set at about the level of the
	temples.  Filling the gaps between these strips and the shokaku
	bo were small plates, sometimes triangular but more commonly
	rectangular in shape.  Because the front projected so
	far from the head, the triangular gap beneath was filled by
	a small plate, the shoshaku tei ita, whose rear edge bent
	downwards into a flange that rested against the forehead.

katana
	The katana is a long, single-edged samurai sword with a
	slightly curved blade.  Its long handle is designed to allow
	it to be wielded with either one or two hands.
ki-rin
	The ki-rin is a strange-looking flying creature.  It has
	scales, a mane like a lion, a tail, hooves, and a horn.  It
	is brightly colored, and can usually be found flying in the
	sky looking for good deeds to reward.
king arthur
*arthur
	Ector took both his sons to the church before which the
	anvil had been placed.  There, standing before the anvil, he
	commanded Kay:  "Put the sword back into the steel if you
	really think the throne is yours!"  But the sword glanced
	off the steel.  "Now it is your turn", Ector said facing
	Arthur.
	The young man lifted the sword and thrust with both arms; the
	blade whizzed through the air with a flash and drilled the
	metal as if it were mere butter.  Ector and Kay dropped to
	their knees before Arthur.
	"Why, father and brother, do you bow before me?", Arthur asked
	with wonder in his voice.
	"Because now I know for sure that you are the king, not only
	by birth but also by law", Ector said.  "You are no son of
	mine nor are you Kay's brother.  Immediately after your birth,
	Merlin the Wise brought you to me to be raised safely.  And
	though it was me that named you Arthur when you were baptized,
	you are really the son of brave king Uther Pendragon and queen
	Igraine..."
	And after these words, the lord rose and went to see the arch-
	bishop to impart to him what had passed.

knight
	Here lies the noble fearless knight,
	Whose valour rose to such a height;
	When Death at last had struck him down,
	His was the victory and renown.
	He reck'd the world of little prize,
	And was a bugbear in men's eyes;
	But had the fortune in his age
	To live a fool and die a sage.

~kobold ??m*
*kobold*
	The race of kobolds are reputed to be an artificial creation
	of a master wizard (demi-god?).  They are about 3' tall with
	a vaguely dog-like face.  They bear a violent dislike of the
	Elven race, and will go out of their way to cause trouble
	for Elves at any time.
*kop*
	The typical policeman of 1920's movies, the Keystone Kop was
	modeled like the English "bobby", with a long brass-buttoned
	overcoat, carrying long nightsticks that he (more often than
	not) whapped himself with, rather than anyone else.  The
	Keystone Kops were very slapstick-like, relying on speed and
	numbers to achieve their comedy, rather than sophisticated
	wit.
kos
	"I am not a coward!" he cried.  "I'll dare Thieves' House
	and fetch you Krovas' head and toss it with blood a-drip at

	dooms, by the brown bones of Nalgron my father and by his
	sword Graywand here at my side!"

kraken
	Out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; it
	was pale-green and luminous and wet.  Its fingered end had
	hold of Frodo's foot, and was dragging him into the water.
	Sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife.  The
	arm let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out
	for help.  Twenty other arms came rippling out.  The dark
	water boiled, and there was a hideous stench.

*lady
offler
	    Blind Io took up the dice-box, which was a skull whose various orifices had
	been stoppered with rubies, and with several of his eyes on the Lady he rolled
	three fives.  She smiled.  This was the nature of the Lady's eyes:  they were
	bright green, lacking iris or pupil, and they glowed from within.
	    The room was silent as she scrabbled in her box of pieces and, from the
	very bottom, produced a couple that she set down on the board with two de-
	cisive clicks.  The rest of the players, as one God, craned forward to peer at
	them.
	    "A wenegade wiffard and fome fort of clerk," said Offler the Crocodile
	God, hindered as usual by his tusks.  "Well, weally!"  With one claw he pushed
	a pile of bone-white tokens into the centre of the table.
	    The Lady nodded slightly.  She picked up the dice-cup and held it as
	steady as a rock, yet all the Gods could hear the three cubes rattling about
	inside.  And then she sent them bouncing across the table.
	    A six.  A three.  A five.
	    Something was happening to the five, however.  Battered by the chance col-
	lision of several billion molecules, the die flipped onto a point, spun gently
	and came down a seven.  Blind Io picked up the cube and counted the sides.
	    "Come _on_," he said wearily, "Play fair."

leprechaun
	The Irish Leprechaun is the Faeries' shoemaker and is known
	under various names in different parts of Ireland:
	Cluricaune in Cork, Lurican in Kerry, Lurikeen in Kildare
	and Lurigadaun in Tipperary.  Although he works for the
	Faeries, the Leprechaun is not of the same species.  He is
	small, has dark skin and wears strange clothes.  His nature
	has something of the manic-depressive about it:  first he
	is quite happy, whistling merrily as he nails a sole on to a
	shoe; a few minutes later, he is sullen and morose, drunk
	on his home-made heather ale.  The Leprechaun's two great
	loves are tobacco and whiskey, and he is a first-rate con-man,
	impossible to out-fox.  No one, no matter how clever, has ever
	managed to cheat him out of his hidden pot of gold or his
	magic shilling.  At the last minute he always thinks of some
	way to divert his captor's attention and vanishes in the
	twinkling of an eye.

*lich
	Once in a great while, an evil master wizard or priest will
	manage through use of great magics to extend his or her life
	far beyond the normal span of a human.  The usual effect of
	this is to transform the human, over time, into an undead of
	great magical power.  A Lich hates life in any form; even a
	touch from one of these creatures will cause a numbing cold
	in the victim.  They all possess the capability to use magic.

	long-tailed bodies of lizards have become modified to enable
	them to live in a wide range of habitats.  Lizards can be
	expert burrowers, runners, swimmers and climbers, and a few
	can manage crude, short-distance gliding on rib-supported
	"wings".  Most are carnivores, feeding on invertebrate and
	small vertebrate prey, but others feed on vegetation.

	"pleasing and handsome in appearance, evil in character, and
	very capricious in behaviour".  He is the son of the giant
	Farbauti and of Laufey.
	Loki is the Norse god of cunning, evil, thieves, and fire.
	He hated the other gods and wanted to ruin them and overthrow
	the universe.  He committed many murders.  As a thief, he
	stole Freyja's necklace, Thor's belt and gauntlets of power,
	and the apples of youth.  Able to shapechange at will, he is
	said to have impersonated at various times a mare, flea, fly,
	falcon, seal, and an old crone.  As a mare he gave birth to
	Odin's horse Sleipnir.  He also allegedly sired the serpent
	Midgard, the mistress of the netherworld, Hel, and the wolf
	Fenrir, who will devour the sun at Ragnarok.

	Yet first was the world in the southern region, which was

lug*
	Lugh, or Lug, was the sun god of the Irish Celts.  One of his
	weapons was a rod-sling which worshippers sometimes saw in
	the sky as a rainbow.  As a tribal god, he was particularly
	skilled in the use of his massive, invincible spear, which
	fought on its own accord.  One of his epithets is _lamfhada_
	(of the long arm).  He was a young and apparently more
	attractive deity than Dagda, the father of the gods.  Being
	able to shapeshift, his name translates as lynx.

lycanthrope
*were*
	In 1573, the Parliament of Dole published a decree, permitting
	the inhabitants of the Franche-Comte to pursue and kill a
	were-wolf or loup-garou, which infested that province,
	"notwithstanding the existing laws concerning the chase."
	The people were empowered to "assemble with javelins,
	halberds, pikes, arquebuses and clubs, to hunt and pursue the
	said were-wolf in all places where they could find it, and to
	take, burn, and kill it, without incurring any fine or other
	penalty."  The hunt seems to have been successful, if we may
	judge from the fact that the same tribunal in the following
	year condemned to be burned a man named Giles Garnier, who
	ran on all fours in the forest and fields and devoured little
	children, "even on Friday."  The poor lycanthrope, it appears,
	had as slight respect for ecclesiastical feasts as the French
	pig, which was not restrained by any feeling of piety from
	eating infants on a fast day.

	unnaturally showed intense gratitude for their lives.  The
	gods were also properly grateful, invested him with many
	titles, and eventually permitted themselves to be embodied in
	him, so that he became supreme god, plotting the whole course
	of known life from the paths of the planets to the daily
	events in the lives of men.

	The marilith has a torso shaped like that of a human female,

	He strolled down the stairs, followed by a number of assassins.
	When he was directly in front of Ymor he said: "I've come for

	"One step more and you'll leave here with fewer eyeballs than
	you came with," said the thiefmaster.  "So sit down and have

	"So?" he said.  "I'll kill him.  Then you rob him.  Is he that
	funny looking one over there?"
	"Yes."
	Zlorf stared at Twoflower, who grinned at him.  He shrugged.
	He seldom wasted time wondering why people wanted other people
	dead.  It was just a living.
	"Who is your client, may I ask?" said Ymor.
	Zlorf held up a hand.  "Please!" he protested.  "Professional
	etiquette."

	There was a flutter of wings at the window.  Ymor shifted his

medusa
	Medusa, one of the three Gorgons or Graeae, is the only one
	of her sisters to have assumed mortal form and inhabited the
	dungeon world.

	When Perseus was grown up Polydectes sent him to attempt the
	conquest of Medusa, a terrible monster who had laid waste the
	country.  She was once a beautiful maiden whose hair was her
	chief glory, but as she dared to vie in beauty with Minerva,
	the goddess deprived her of her charms and changed her
	beautiful ringlets into hissing serpents.  She became a cruel
	monster of so frightful an aspect that no living thing could
	behold her without being turned into stone.  All around the
	cavern where she dwelt might be seen the stony figures of men
	and animals which had chanced to catch a glimpse of her and
	had been petrified with the sight.  Perseus, favoured by
	Minerva and Mercury, the former of whom lent him her shield
	and the latter his winged shoes, approached Medusa while she
	slept and taking care not to look directly at her, but guided
	by her image reflected in the bright shield which he bore, he
	cut off her head and gave it to Minerva, who fixed it in the
	middle of her Aegis.

mind flayer
	This creature has a humanoid body, tentacles around its

mit*ra*
	Originating in India (Mitra), Mithra is a god of light who
	was translated into the attendant of the god Ahura Mazda in
	the light religion of Persia; from this he was adopted as
	the Roman deity Mithras.  He is not generally regarded as a
	sky god but a personification of the fertilizing power of
	warm, light air.  According to the _Avesta_, he possesses
	10,000 eyes and ears and rides in a chariot drawn by white
	horses.  Mithra, according to Zarathustra, is concerned with
	the endless battle between light and dark forces:  he
	represents truth.  He is responsible for the keeping of oaths
	and contracts.  He is attributed with the creation of both
	plants and animals.  His chief adversary is Ahriman, the
	power of darkness.

mjollnir
	Forged by the dwarves Eitri and Brokk, in response to Loki's
	challenge, Mjollnir is an indestructible war hammer.  It has
	two magical properties:  when thrown it always returned to
	Thor's hand; and it could be made to shrink in size until it
	could fit inside Thor's shirt.  Its only flaw is that it has
	a short handle.  The other gods judged Mjollnir the winner of
	the contest because, of all the treasures created, it alone had
	the power to protect them from the giants.  As the legends
	surrounding Mjollnir grew, it began to take on the quality of
	"vigja", or consecration.  Thor used it to consecrate births,
	weddings, and even to raise his goats from the dead.  In the
	Norse mythologies Mjollnir is considered to represent Thor's
	governance over the entire cycle of life - fertility, birth,
	destruction, and resurrection.

	startled Mrs. Hall.  It was the fact that all his forehead
	above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage, and
	that another covered his ears, leaving not a scrap of his
	face exposed excepting only his pink, peaked nose.  It was
	bright, pink, and shiny just as it had been at first.  He
	wore a dark-brown velvet jacket with a high, black, linen-
	lined collar turned up about his neck.  The thick black

naginata
	A Japanese pole-arm, fitted with a curved single-edged blade.
	The blades ranged in length from two to four feet, mounted on
	shafts about four to five feet long.  The naginata were cut
	with a series of short grooves near to the tang, above which
	the back edge was thinned, but not sharpened, so that the
	greater part of the blade was a flattened diamond shape in
	section.  Seen in profile, the curve is slight or non-
	existent near the tang, becoming more pronounced towards the
	point.

	"With his naginata he killed five, but with the sixth it
	snapped asunder in the midst and, flinging it away, he drew
	his sword, wielding it in the zigzag style, the interlacing,
	cross, reversed dragonfly, waterwheel, and eight-sides-at-
	once styles of fencing and cutting down eight men; but as he
	brought down the ninth with a mighty blow on the helmet, the
	blade snapped at the hilt."

ninja-to
	A Japanese broadsword.
*norn
	The Norns were the three Norse Fates, or the goddesses of fate.
	Female giants, they brought the wonderful Golden Age to an end.
	They cast lots over the cradle of every child that was born,
	and placed gifts in the cradle.  Their names were Urda,
	Verdandi, and Skuld, representing the past, the present, and
	the future.  Urda and Verdandi were kindly disposed, but Skuld
	was cruel and savage.  Their tasks were to sew the web of
	fate, to water the sacred ash, Yggdrasil, and to keep it in
	good condition by placing fresh earth around it daily.  In her
	fury, Skuld often spoiled the work of her sisters by tearing
	the web to shreds.

nunchaku
	A Japanese flail.
*nymph
	A female creature from Roman and Greek mythology, the nymph
	occupied rivers, forests, ponds, etc.  A nymph's beauty is
	beyond words:  an ever-young woman with sleek figure and
	long, thick hair, radiant skin and perfect teeth, full lips
	and gentle eyes.  A nymph's scent is delightful, and her
	long robe glows, hemmed with golden threads and embroidered
	with rainbow hues of unearthly magnificence.  A nymph's
	demeanour is graceful and charming, her mind quick and witty.

	"Theseus felt her voice pulling him down into fathoms of
	sleep.	The song was the skeleton of his dream, and the dream
	was full of terror.  Demon girls were after him, and a bull-
	man was goring him.  Everywhere there was blood.  There was
	pain.  There was fear.	But his head was in the nymph's lap
	and her musk was about him, her voice weaving the dream.  He
	knew then that she had been sent to tell him of something
	dreadful that was to happen to him later.  Her song was a
	warning.  But she had brought him a new kind of joy, one that
	made him see everything differently.  The boy, who was to
	become a hero, suddenly knew then what most heroes learn
	later -- and some too late -- that joy blots suffering and
	that the road to nymphs is beset by monsters."
	    [ The Minotaur by Bernard Evslin ]
odin
	Also called Sigtyr (god of Victory), Val-father (father of
	the slain), One-Eyed, Hanga-god (god of the hanged), Farma-
	god (god of cargoes), Hapta-god (god of prisoners), and
	Othin.  He is the prime god of the Norsemen:  god of war and
	victory, wisdom and prophecy, poetry, the dead, air and wind,
	hospitality, and magic.
	As the god of war and victory, Odin is ruler of the Valkyries,
	warrior-maidens who lived in the halls of Valhalla in Asgard,
	the hall of dead heroes where he held his court.
	These chosen ones will defend the realm of the gods against
	the Frost Giants on the final day of reckoning, Ragnarok.
	As god of the wind, Odin rides through the air on his eight-
	footed horse, Sleipnir, wielding Gungner, his spear, normally
	accompanied by his ravens, Hugin and Munin, who he would also
	use as his spies.
	As a god of hospitality, he enjoys visiting the earth in
	disguise to see how people were behaving and to see how they
	would treat him, not knowing who he was.
	Odin is usually represented as a one-eyed wise old man with a
	long white beard and a wide-brimmed hat (he gave one of his
	eyes to Mimir, the guardian of the well of wisdom in Hel, in
	exchange for a draught of knowledge).
ogre*
	Anyone who has met a gluttonous, nude, angry ogre, will not
	easily forget this encounter -- if he survives it at all.
	Both male and female ogres can easily grow as tall as three
	metres.  Build and facial expressions would remind one of a
	Neanderthal.  Its small, pointy, keen teeth are striking.
	Since ogres avoid direct sunlight, their ragged, unfurry
	skin is as white as a sheet.  They enjoy coating their body
	with lard and usually wear nothing but a loin-cloth.  An elf
	would smell its rancid stench at ten metres distance.
	Ogres are solitary creatures:  very rarely one may encounter
	a female with two or three young.  They are the only real
	carnivores among the humanoids, and its favourite meal is --
	not surprisingly -- human flesh.  They sometimes ally with
	orcs or goblins, but only when they anticipate a good meaty
	meal.

olog-hai
	But at the end of the Third Age a troll-race not before seen
	appeared in southern Mirkwood and in the mountain borders of
	Mordor.  Olog-hai they were called in the Black Speech.  That
	Sauron bred them none doubted, though from what stock was not
	known.  Some held that they were not Trolls but giant Orcs;
	but the Olog-hai were in fashion of body and mind quite unlike
	even the largest of Orc-kind, whom they far surpassed in size
	and power.  Trolls they were, but filled with the evil will
	of their master:  a fell race, strong, agile, fierce and
	cunning, but harder than stone.  Unlike the older race of the
	Twilight they could endure the Sun....  They spoke little,
	and the only tongue they knew was the Black Speech of Barad-dur.

*ooze
*pudding
	These giant amoeboid creatures look like nothing more than
	puddles of slime, but they both live and move, feeding on
	metal or wood as well as the occasional dungeon explorer to
	supplement their diet.
oracle
delphi
p*thia
	Delphi under towering Parnassus, where Apollo's oracle was,
	plays an important part in mythology.  Castalia was its
	sacred spring; Cephissus its river.  It was held to be the
	center of the world, so many pilgrims came to it, from
	foreign countries as well as Greece.  No other shrine rivaled
	it.  The answers to the questions asked by the anxious
	seekers for Truth were delivered by a priestess who went into
	a trance before she spoke.
		[ Mythology, by Edith Hamilton ]
orb of detection
	This Orb is a crystal ball of exceptional powers.  When
	carried, it grants ESP, limits damage done by spells, and
	protects the carrier from magic missiles.  When invoked it
	allows the carrier to become invisible.
orb of fate
	Some say that Odin himself created this ancient crystal ball,
	although others argue that Loki created it and forged Odin's
	signature on the bottom.  In any case, it is a powerful
	artifact.  Anyone who carries it is granted the gift of
	warning, and damage, both spell and physical, is partially
	absorbed by the orb itself.  When invoked it has the power
	to teleport the invoker between levels.
goblin king
orcrist
	The Great Goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when he
	looked at it, and all his soldiers gnashed their teeth,
	clashed their shields, and stamped.  They knew the sword at
	once.  It had killed hundreds of goblins in its time, when
	the fair elves of Gondolin hunted them in the hills or did
	battle before their walls.  They had called it Orcrist,
	Goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it simply Biter.
	They hated it and hated worse any one that carried it.

orcus
	Orcus, Prince of the Undead, has a ram's head and a poison
	stinger.  He is most feared, though, for his powerful magic
	abilities.  His wand causes death to those he chooses.
~orc ??m*
*orc*
uruk*hai
	Orcs, bipeds with a humanoid appearance, are related to the
	goblins, but much bigger and more dangerous.  The average orc
	is only moderately intelligent, has broad, muscled shoulders,
	a short neck, a sloping forehead and a thick, dark fur.
	Their lower eye-teeth are pointing forward, like a boar's.
	Female orcs are more lightly built and bare-chested.  Not
	needing any clothing, they do like to dress in variegated
	apparels.  Suspicious by nature, orcs live in tribes or
	hordes.  They tend to live underground as well as above
	ground (but they dislike sunlight).  Orcs can use all weapons,
	tools and armours that are used by men.  Since they don't have
	the talent to fashion these themselves, they are constantly
	hunting for them.  There is nothing a horde of orcs cannot
	use.

osaku
	The osaku is a small tool for picking locks.
owlbear
	Owlbears are probably the crossbreed creation of a demented
	wizard; given the lethal nature of this creation, it is quite
	likely the wizard who created them is no longer alive.  As
	the name might already suggest, owlbears are a cross between
	a giant owl and a bear.  They are covered with fur and
	feathers.
palantir of westernesse
	The elves of long ago created this powerful crystal ball.
	When carried, it grants ESP, regeneration, and reduces all
	damage caused by spells to one-half of what it would have
	normally been.  When invoked, it tames creatures in its
	vicinity.
*piercer
	Ye Piercer doth look like unto a stalactyte, and hangeth
	from the roofs of caves and caverns.  Unto the height of a
	man, and thicker than a man's thigh do they grow, and in
	groups do they hang.  If a creature doth pass beneath them,
	they will by its heat and noise perceive it, and fall upon
	it to kill and devour it, though in any other way they move
	but exceeding slow.

	domains.
platinum yendorian express card
	This is an ancient artifact made of an unknown material.  It
	is rectangular in shape, very thin, and inscribed with
	unreadable ancient runes.  When carried, it grants the one
	who carries it ESP, and reduces all physical damage done to
	the carrier by half.  It also protects from magic missile
	attacks.  Finally, its power is such that when invoked, it
	can charge other objects.
poseido*n
	Poseido(o)n, lord of the seas and father of rivers and
	fountains, was the son of Chronos and Rhea, brother of Zeus,
	Hades, Hera, Hestia and Demeter.  His rank of ruler of the
	waves he received by lot at the Council Meeting of the Gods,
	at which Zeus took the upper world for himself and gave
	dominion over the lower world to Hades.
	Poseidon is associated in many ways with horses and thus is
	the god of horses.  He taught men how to ride and manage the
	animal he invented and is looked upon as the originator and
	guardian deity of horse races.
	His symbol is the familiar trident or three-pronged spear
	with which he can split rocks, cause or quell storms, and
	shake the earth, a power which makes him the god of
	earthquakes as well.  Physically, he is shown as a strong and
	powerful ruler, every inch a king.

		  Nations, by Herbert Robinson and Knox Wilson ]
ptah
	Known under various names (Nu, Neph, Cenubis, Amen-Kneph,
	Khery-Bakef), Ptah is the creator god and god of craftsmen.
	He is usually depicted as wearing a closely fitting robe
	with only his hands free.  His most distinctive features are
	the invariable skull-cap exposing only his face and ears,
	and the _was_ or rod of domination which he holds,
	consisting of a staff surmounted by the _ankh_ symbol of
	life.  He is otherwise symbolized by his sacred animal, the
	bull.
*purple worm
	A gargantuan version of the harmless rain-worm, the purple
	worm poses a huge threat to the ordinary adventurer.  It is
	known to swallow whole and digest its victims within only a
	few minutes.  These worms are always on guard, sensitive
	to the most minute vibrations in the earth, but may also
	be awakened by a remote shriek.
quadruped
	The woodlands and other regions are inhabited by multitudes
	of four-legged creatures which cannot be simply classified.
	They might not have fiery breath or deadly stings, but
	adventurers have nevertheless met their end numerous times
	due to the claws, hooves, or bites of such animals.
quantum mechanic
	These creatures are not native to this universe; they seem
	to have strangely derived powers, and unknown motives.
quasit
	Quasits are small, evil creatures, related to imps.  Their
	talons release a very toxic poison when used in an attack.
quetzalcoatl
	One of the principal Aztec-Toltec gods was the great and wise
	Quetzalcoatl, who was called Kukumatz in Guatemala, and
	Kukulcan in Yucatan.  His image, the plumed serpent, is found
	on both the oldest and the most recent Indian edifices. ...
	The legend tells how the Indian deity Quetzalcoatl came from
	the "Land of the Rising Sun".  He wore a long white robe and
	had a beard; he taught the people crafts and customs and laid
	down wise laws.  He created an empire in which the ears of
	corn were as long as men are tall, and caused bolls of colored
	cotton to grow on cotton plants.  But for some reason or other
	he had to leave his empire. ...  But all the legends of
	Quetzalcoatl unanimously agree that he promised to come again.

	Rats are long-tailed rodents.  They are aggressive,

rock mole
	A rock mole is a member of the rodent family.  They get their
	name from their ability to tunnel through rock in the same
	fashion that a mole tunnels through earth.  They are known to
	eat anything they come across in their diggings, although it
	is still unknown how they convert some of these things into
	something of nutritional value.
rogue
	I understand the business, I hear it: to have an open ear, a
	quick eye, and a nimble hand, is necessary for a cut-purse; a
	good nose is requisite also, to smell out work for the other
	senses.  I see this is the time that the unjust man doth
	thrive. <...> The prince himself is about a piece of iniquity,
	stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels:  if
	I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king

	Japanese rice wine.
salamander
	For hundreds of years, many people believed that salamanders
	were magical.  In England in the Middle Ages, people thought
	that fire created salamanders.  When they set fire to damp
	logs, dozens of the slimy creatures scurried out.  The word
	salamander, in fact, comes from a Greek word meaning "fire
	animal".

	wild.  -- What now, Slasher, are you hunting the men who
	killed your master?" ...  "Let him come," muttered Conan.
	"He can smell the devils before we can see them." ...
	Slasher cleared the timbers with a bound and leaped into the
	bushes.  They were violently shaken and then the dog slunk
	back to Balthus' side, his jaws crimson. ...  "He was a man,"
	said Conan.  "I drink to his shade, and to the shade of the
	dog, who knew no fear."  He quaffed part of the wine, then
	emptied the rest upon the floor, with a curious heathen

	immotile reproductive phase.  The motile phase, commonly
	found under rotting logs and damp leaves, consists of either
	solitary amoebalike cells or a brightly colored multinucleate
	mass of protoplasm called a plasmodium, which creeps about
	and feeds by amoeboid movement.

	the fruit of the trees of the garden:  but of the fruit of the tree which is
	in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither
	shall ye touch it, lest ye die.  And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall

	To prepare fresh tripe, trim if necessary.  Wash it thoroughly,
	soaking overnight, and blanch, for 1/2 hour in salted water.
	Wash well again, drain and cut for cooking.  When cooked, the
	texture of tripe should be like that of soft gristle.  More

	thick claw-footed legs to the ground, made it hard to tell.
	The hairless green skin moved upon his body.  His head was a
	gash of a mouth, a yard-long nose, and two eyes which drank
	the feeble torchlight and never gave back a gleam.
	[...]
	Like a huge green spider, the troll's severed hand ran on its
	fingers.  Across the mounded floor, up onto a log with one
	taloned forefinger to hook it over the bark, down again it
	scrambled, until it found the cut wrist.  And there it grew
	fast.  The troll's smashed head seethed and knit together.
	He clambered back on his feet and grinned at them.  The
	waning faggot cast red light over his fangs.

tsurugi of muramasa
	This most ancient of swords has been passed down through the
	leadership of the Samurai legions for hundreds of years.  It
	is said to grant luck to its wielder, but its main power is
	terrible to behold.  It has the capability to cut in half any
	creature it is wielded against, instantly killing them.
tsurugi
	The tsurugi, also known as the long samurai sword, is an
	extremely sharp, two-handed blade favored by the samurai.
	It is made of hardened steel, and is manufactured using a
	special process, causing it to never rust.  The tsurugi is
	rumored to be so sharp that it can occasionally cut
	opponents in half!
twoflower
guide
	"Rincewind!"
	Twoflower sprang off the bed.  The wizard jumped back,
	wrenching his features into a smile.
	"My dear chap, right on time!  We'll just have lunch, and
	then I'm sure you've got a wonderful programme lined up for
	this afternoon!"
	"Er --"
	"That's great!"
	Rincewind took a deep breath.  "Look," he said desperately,
	"let's eat somewhere else.  There's been a bit of a fight
	down below."
	"A tavern brawl?  Why didn't you wake me up?"
	"Well, you see, I - _what_?"
	"I thought I made myself clear this morning, Rincewind.  I
	want to see genuine Morporkian life - the slave market, the
	Whore Pits, the Temple of Small Gods, the Beggar's Guild...
	and a genuine tavern brawl."  A faint note of suspicion
	entered Twoflower's voice.  "You _do_ have them, don't you?
	You know, people swinging on chandeliers, swordfights over
	the table, the sort of thing Hrun the Barbarian and the
	Weasel are always getting involved in.  You know --
	_excitement_."
		[ The Colour of Magic, by Terry Pratchett ]
tyaa
	An evil goddess, she is able to command all forms of birds
	to do her bidding.
tyr
	Yet remains that one of the Aesir who is called Tyr:
	he is most daring, and best in stoutness of heart, and he
	has much authority over victory in battle; it is good for
	men of valor to invoke him.  It is a proverb, that he is
	Tyr-valiant, who surpasses other men and does not waver.
	He is wise, so that it is also said, that he that is wisest
	is Tyr-prudent.  This is one token of his daring:  when the
	Aesir enticed Fenris-Wolf to take upon him the fetter Gleipnir,
	the wolf did not believe them, that they would loose him,
	until they laid Tyr's hand into his mouth as a pledge.  But
	when the Aesir would not loose him, then he bit off the hand
	at the place now called 'the wolf's joint;' and Tyr is one-
	handed, and is not called a reconciler of men.
			[ The Prose Edda, by Snorri Sturluson ]
*hulk
	Umber hulks are powerful subterranean predators whose
	iron-like claws allow them to burrow through solid stone in
	search of prey.  They are tremendously strong; muscles bulge
	beneath their thick, scaly hides and their powerful arms and
	legs all end in great claws.
*unicorn
unicorn horn
	Men have always sought the elusive unicorn, for the single twisted horn which
	projected from its forehead was thought to be a powerful talisman.  It was
	said that the unicorn had simply to dip the tip of its horn in a muddy pool
	for the water to become pure.  Men also believed that to drink from this horn
	was a protection against all sickness, and that if the horn was ground to a
	powder it would act as an antidote to all poisons.  Less than 200 years ago in
	France, the horn of a unicorn was used in a ceremony to test the royal food
	for poison.

	Although only the size of a small horse, the unicorn is a very fierce beast,
	capable of killing an elephant with a single thrust from its horn.  Its fleet-
	ness of foot also makes this solitary creature difficult to capture.  However,
	it can be tamed and captured by a maiden.  Made gentle by the sight of a vir-
	gin, the unicorn can be lured to lay its head in her lap, and in this docile
	mood, the maiden may secure it with a golden rope.
		[Mythical Beasts by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library)]

	Martin took a small sip of beer.  "Almost ready," he said.  "You hold your
	beer awfully well."
	Tlingel laughed.  "A unicorn's horn is a detoxicant.  Its possession is a
	universal remedy.  I wait until I reach the warm glow stage, then I use my
	horn to burn off any excess and keep me right there."
		[Unicorn Variations by Roger Zelazny]
valkyrie
	The Valkyries were the thirteen choosers of the slain, the
	beautiful warrior-maids of Odin who rode through the air and
	over the sea.  They watched the progress of the battle and
	selected the heroes who were to fall fighting.  After they
	were dead, the maidens rewarded the heroes by kissing them
	and then led their souls to Valhalla, where the warriors
	lived happily in an ideal existence, drinking and eating
	without restraint and fighting over again the battles in
	which they died and in which they had won their deathless
	fame.

			Nations, by Herbert Robinson and Knox

vampire
vampire bat
vampire lord
	The Oxford English Dictionary is quite unequivocal:
	_vampire_ - "a preternatural being of a malignant nature (in
	the original and usual form of the belief, a reanimated
	corpse), supposed to seek nourishment, or do harm, by sucking
	the blood of sleeping persons. ..."
vlad*
	Vlad Dracula the Impaler was a 15th-Century monarch of the
	Birgau region of the Carpathian Mountains, in what is now
	Romania.  In Romanian history he is best known for two things.
	One was his skilled handling of the Ottoman Turks, which kept
	them from making further inroads into Christian Europe.  The
	other was the ruthless manner in which he ran his fiefdom.
	He dealt with perceived challengers to his rule by impaling
	them upright on wooden stakes.  Visiting dignitaries who
	failed to doff their hats had them nailed to their head.
*vortex
vortices
	Swirling clouds of pure elemental energies, the vortices are
	thought to be related to the larger elementals.  Though the
	vortices do no damage when touched, they are noted for being
	able to envelop unwary travellers.  The hapless fool thus
	swallowed by a vortex will soon perish from exposure to the
	element the vortex is composed of.
vrock
	The vrock is one of the weaker forms of demon.  It resembles
	a cross between a human being and a vulture and does physical
	damage by biting and by using the claws on both its arms and
	feet.
wakizashi
	The samurai warrior traditionally wears two swords; the
	wakizashi is the shorter of the two.  See also katana.
warg
	Suddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet.  "How the wind howls!"
	he cried.  "It is howling with wolf-voices.  The Wargs have
	come west of the Mountains!"
	"Need we wait until morning then?" said Gandalf.  "It is as I
	said.  The hunt is up!  Even if we live to see the dawn, who
	now will wish to journey south by night with the wild wolves
	on his trail?"
	"How far is Moria?" asked Boromir.
	"There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles
	as the crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,"
	answered Gandalf grimly.
	"Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if we can,"
	said Boromir.  "The wolf that one hears is worse then the orc
	that one fears."
	"True!" said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath.  "But
	where the warg howls, there also the orc prowls."
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
*wight
	When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall
	nothing except a sense of dread.  Then suddenly he knew that
	he was imprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow.  A
	Barrow-wight had taken him, and he was probably already under
	the dreadful spells of the Barrow-wights about which whispered
	tales spoke.  He dared not move, but lay as he found himself:
	flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his
	breast.
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
wizard of balance
	The Wizard of Balance holds office in his hidden tower, only
	reachable by magical means, where he teaches his apprentices
	the enigmatic skills of occultism.  He considers himself a
	guardian of the equilibrium of the universe, and goes out of
	his way to promote stability.
wizard of yendor
	No one knows how old this mighty wizard is, or from whence he
	came.  It is known that, having lived a span far greater than
	any normal man's, he grew weary of lesser mortals; and so,
	spurning all human company, he forsook the dwellings of men
	and went to live in the depths of the Earth.  He took with
	him a dreadful artifact, the Book of the Dead, which is said
	to hold great power indeed.  Many have sought to find the
	wizard and his treasure, but none have found him and lived to
	tell the tale.  Woe be to the incautious adventurer who
	disturbs this mighty sorcerer!
wolf
*wolf
	The ancestors of the modern day domestic dog, wolves are
	powerful muscular animals with bushy tails.  Intelligent,
	social animals, wolves live in family groups or packs made
	up of multiple family units.  These packs cooperate in hunting
	down prey.
*worm
long worm tail
worm tooth
crysknife
	[The crysknife] is manufactured in two forms from teeth taken
	from dead sandworms.  The two forms are "fixed" and "unfixed".
	An unfixed knife requires proximity to a human body's
	electrical field to prevent disintegration.  Fixed knives
	are treated for storage.  All are about 20 centimeters long.
		[ Dune, by Frank Herbert ]
wraith
nazgul
	Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim
	and dark, the shapes became terribly clear.  He was able to
	see beneath their black wrappings.  There were five tall
	figures:  two standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing.
	In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; under
	their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs
	were helms of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of
	steel.  Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they
	rushed towards him.  Desperate, he drew his own sword, and
	it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a
	firebrand.  Two of the figures halted.  The third was taller
	than the others:  his hair was long and gleaming and on his
	helm was a crown.  In one hand he held a long sword, and in
	the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it
	glowed with a pale light.  He sprang forward and bore down
	on Frodo.
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
wumpus
	The Wumpus, by the way, is not bothered by the hazards since
	he has sucker feet and is too big for a bat to lift.  If you
	try to shoot him and miss, there's also a chance that he'll
	up and move himself into another cave, though by nature the
	Wumpus is a sedentary creature.
		[ wump (6) -- "Hunt the Wumpus" ]
xan
	They sent their friend the mosquito [xan] ahead of them to
	find out what lay ahead.  "Since you are the one who sucks
	the blood of men walking along paths," they told the mosquito,
	"go and sting the men of Xibalba."  The mosquito flew
	down the dark road to the Underworld.  Entering the house of
	the Lords of Death, he stung the first person that he saw...

	The mosquito stung this man as well, and when he yelled, the
	man next to him asked, "Gathered Blood, what's wrong?"  So
	he flew along the row stinging all the seated men until he
	knew the names of all twelve.
			[ Popul Vuh, as translated by Ralph Nelson ]
xorn
	A distant cousin of the earth elemental, the xorn has the
	ability to shift the cells of its body around in such a way
	that it becomes porous to inert material.  This gives it the
	ability to pass through any obstacle that might be between it
	and its next meal.
ya
	The arrow of choice of the samurai, ya are made of very
	straight bamboo, and are tipped with hardened steel.
yeenoghu
	Yeenoghu, the demon lord of gnolls, still exists although
	all his followers have been wiped off the face of the earth.
	He casts magic projectiles at those close to him, and a mere
	gaze into his piercing eyes may hopelessly confuse the
	battle-weary adventurer.
yeti
	An ape-like humanoid native to inaccessible mountain tops,
	the yeti is also known as "the abominable snowman".  Whether
	or not the title "man" is appropriate remains unknown.
yugake
	Japanese leather archery gloves.  Gloves made for use while
	practicing had thumbs reinforced with horn.  Those worn into
	battle had thumbs reinforced with a double layer of leather.
yumi
	The samurai is highly trained with a special type of bow,
	the yumi.  Like the ya, the yumi is made of bamboo.  With
	the yumi-ya, the bow and arrow, the samurai is an extremely
	accurate and deadly warrior.
*zombie
	The zombi... is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but
	taken from the grave and endowed by sorcery with a
	mechanical semblance of life, -- it is a dead body which is
	made to walk and act and move as if it were alive.
		[ W. B. Seabrook ]
zruty
	The zruty are wild and gigantic beings, living in the
	wildernesses of the Tatra mountains.
