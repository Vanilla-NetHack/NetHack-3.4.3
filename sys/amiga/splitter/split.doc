	Splitter			[split.doc 93/01/08]

Usage:
	splitter [-Cc_prototype] [-Dd_prototype] [-ddir_prototype] binary

Default prototypes:
	d: %n.dir
	C: %n.c%C
	D: %n.d%D

Prototypes:
	%n	base file name
	%C	current code file #
	%D	current data file #

Creates:
	binary.dir		directions file
	binary.d00		data files
	binary.d01 ...
	binary.c00		code files
	binary.c01 ...

Format of the directions file (subject to change):
	Cbinary.c00
	Cbinary.c01
	Cbinary.c02
	Dbinary.d00
	Dbinary.d01
The above entries may be edited to reflect the location of the various files
if it is necessary for them to be moved by the user.  All C entries must
preceed all D entries.

Maximum output file size is 800K (819200 bytes) - this leaves just enough
space on an empty floppy for a small icon.

Code file contents:
The first code file contains:
	the (modified) HUNK_HEADER from the original binary
	(followed by)
All code files contain:
	HUNK_CODE's from the original binary

Data file contents:
	HUNK_BSS's from the original binary
	HUNK_DATA's from the original binary

COMPILING
	[SASC5]
	lc -L splitter.c arg.c

BUGS
	The present system for generating multiple files is a hack -
	multi.[ch] should be upgraded instead.

	Many optimizations for minimizing the size of the output file
	could/should/will be added.

	Not tested with SASC 6.0 yet.
